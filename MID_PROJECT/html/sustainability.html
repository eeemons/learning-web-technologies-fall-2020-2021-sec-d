        Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; 
        therefore how critical water, land, and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, 
        and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. 
        Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, 
        such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, 
        or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.
        Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable. 
        Technology permits innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, reduces water pollution, and enhances carbon sequestration. 
        Other potential practices include conservation agriculture, agroforestry, improved grazing, avoided grassland conversion, and biochar.Current mono-crop farming practices in the United States preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices, 
        such as 2-3 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops, unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy.
        According to a report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; 
        using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, IFPRI found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.
        The caloric demand of Earth's projected population, with current climate change predictions, can be satisfied by additional improvement of agricultural methods, expansion of agricultural areas, and a sustainability-oriented consumer mindset.
