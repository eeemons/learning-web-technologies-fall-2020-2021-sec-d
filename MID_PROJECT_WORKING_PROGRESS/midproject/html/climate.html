    <h1>Climate change</h1>
    <p>
        Climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale. 
        Global warming affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and weather extremes (like storms and heat waves); 
        changes in pests and diseases; changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; 
        changes in the nutritional quality of some foods; and changes in sea level.[174] Global warming is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world.
        Future climate change will probably negatively affect crop production in low latitude countries, while effects in northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Global warming will probably 
        increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups, such as the poor.
        Animal husbandry is also responsible for greenhouse gas production of CO
        2 and a percentage of the world's methane, and future land infertility, and the displacement of wildlife. 
        Agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use.
        Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around 20 to 25% to global annual emissions in 2010.
        A range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture,
        and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector.
