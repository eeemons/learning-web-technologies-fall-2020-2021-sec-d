                    Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock.<br>
                    Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization,<br>
                    whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live <br>
                    in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains <br>
                    beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago.<br>
                    Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated <br>
                    in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the <br>
                    twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended<br>
                    on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first. <br>

                    Origin Of Agriculture

                <p align="right">
                    The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering. 
                    Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centres of origin. 
                    Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. 
                    From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. 
                    Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. 
                    Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.
                    Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.
                    Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia, where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.
                    In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. 
                    Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. 
                    Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. 
                    Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. 
                    In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.
                    Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. 
                    Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; 
                    examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. 
                    Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated
