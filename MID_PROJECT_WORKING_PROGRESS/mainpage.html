    <h1>Agriculture</h1>
    <p>
        Agriculture is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock.<br>
        Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization,<br>
        whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live <br>
        in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains <br>
        beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago.<br>
        Pigs, sheep and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated <br>
        in at least 11 regions of the world. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the <br>
        twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people still depended<br>
        on subsistence agriculture into the twenty-first.<br>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
        The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering.<br>
        Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,[10] and included a diverse range of taxas, <br>
        in at least 11 separate centres of origin. <br>
        Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago <br>
        From around 11,500 years ago, the eight Neolithic founder crops, emmer and einkorn wheat, hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax were cultivated in the Levant. <br>
        Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[12] followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. <br>
        Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.[13] Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.<br>
        Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,[15] where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago. <br>
        In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. <br>
        Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. <br>
        Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,[17] and was independently domesticated in Eurasia.<br>
        In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.<br>
        Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. <br>
        Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of <br>
        intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, <br>
        and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. <br>
        Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, <br>
        and gradually came to be domesticated<br>
